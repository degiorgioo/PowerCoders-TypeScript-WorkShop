## Run the code
Before the code can be run, the dependencies have to be installed. Dependencies:
- Node: https://nodejs.org/en/
- TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links 

The JavaScript can be run with the nodejs commandline tool.

```
node <path_to_js_file>
```

example:
```
node JavaScript/printSum.js
```

The TypeScript code can be run with the typescript compiler. It's also a CLI-Tool.

```
tsc <path_to_tsc_file>
```

example:
```
tsc TypeScript/printSumTypeScript.ts
```

Hint: If the TypeScript code is correct, a .js-file is created in the folder. This is the corresponding JavaScript code.
